MERRA-2
*******
The Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) is
a global atmospheric reanalysis produced by the NASA Global Modeling and Assimilation Office
(GMAO). It spans the satellite observing era from 1980 to the present. The goals of MERRA-2
are to provide a regularly-gridded, homogeneous record of the global atmosphere, and to
incorporate additional aspects of the climate system including trace gas constituents
(stratospheric ozone), and improved land surface representation, and cryospheric processes.

COSMO-CLM + MERRA2
******************
Atmospheric hindcast for Western Europe and the North Atlantic using
COSMO-CLM version 5.0 with spectral nudging from 2002-2017.
MERRA2 reanalysis data are used as forcing.
