Integrated Forecast System (IFS)
================================
The Integrated Forecast System (IFS) is the global NWP model suite of the
European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF).

ICON
====
The ICON modelling framework is a joint project between the German Weather Service
and the Max Planck Institute for Meteorology for developing a unified next-generation
global numerical weather prediction and climate modelling system. The ICON model has
been introduced into DWD's operational forecast system in January 2015.

COSMO
=====
The Consortium for Small-scale Modeling (COSMO) was formed in October 1998.
Its general goal is to develop, improve and maintain a non-hydrostatic limited-area
atmospheric model, to be used both for operational and for research applications by
the members of the consortium (details). Moreover, within a licence agreement, the
COSMO model may be used for operational and research applications by other national
(hydro-)meteorological services, universities and research institutes.

.. note::

    The COSMO science plan calls for a harmonization of development of the COSMO and ICON
    (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) models in the time horizon of 2020. Further development
    of the COSMO model will be reduced during 2019. Development and testing of new features
    will be restricted mainly to ICON.


ICON-ART and COSMO-ART
======================
The model systems ICON-ART (global) and COSMO-ART (regional) are characterized by the
online-coupling of the NWP-models of DWD with the ART modules for the treatment of
Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases in the atmosphere developed at the
Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT).

HIRLAM
******
Since 2006, the HIRLAM cooperation shifted its focus to the development of meso-scale
(convection-permitting) numerical weather prediction system (HARMONIE) through close
collaboration with the ALADIN consortium (led by Meteo France) and the
ECMWF (European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting).

HARMONIE
========
The HARMONIE forecast system is the main operational weather forecast system at HIRLAM
weather services with a typical grid resolution of 2.5 km.

GLAMEPS
=======
Through collaboration with the ALADIN consortium, a 52-ensemble Pan-European Grand Limited
Area Ensemble Prediction System (GLAMEPS) has been developed by the HIRLAM programme.
With a resolution of ca 8 km grid size GLAMEPS has been operational since 2013, to serve
the needs of 2-day probabilistic forecasts at the HIRLAM and ALADIN member services.
